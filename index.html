        <p>
          I am a polite and reliable individual with a proven ability to work
          with others in high-stress environments. Working as a Porter in the
          A&E department necessitated me to develop many skills like following
          instructions swiftly and carefully and communicating with relevant
          staff. I have a Level 3 qualification in engineering at D*DD and
          possess a natural problem-solving mind.

        <p class="story-p">
          Like alot of people my age after I finished sixth form I was confused
          about what career I wanted to take so I ended up just working a normal
          job, During the covid pandemic after seeing so many people lose their
          jobs, I realized that I needed a skill so that I wouldn't be dependent
          on my current job. I began to look again to try and find a career that
          I liked and eventually stumbled upon web development, At first, I was
          highly skeptical because of previous experiences I had with
          programming in my engineering course however I decided to give it
          another go. I quickly fell in love with it due to my natural
          mathematical/problem-solving mind and my keen eye for design, I was
          also just astonished at the sheer amount of things that could be
          programmed and how the industry was only growing. I now dedicate 40
          hours a week to developing this skill and aspire to be a source of
          motivation in the programming community.
